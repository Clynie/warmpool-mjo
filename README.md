# warm pool-mjo
MJO events and the code for estimating the phase duration and warm pool area as in Roxy et al. 2019, Nature, "Twofold expansion of the Indo-Pacific warm pool warps the MJO lifecycle".

<<<<<<< HEAD
* "MJO_events" directory contains list of MJO events from 1981-2018 (Nov-Apr), MJO phase durations and Hovmöller diagrams of filtered  NOAA OLR and CMAP precipitation. 
* "scripts" directory contains the python,ncl and shell scripts used for estimating different statistics of MJO lifecycle and warm pool area.
